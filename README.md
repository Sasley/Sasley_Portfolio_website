###Description
I want the user to experience my personalities, passion, and hard-work. This project will help others view, experience, and like my work. The purpose is for employment or inspiration. I learned how complex CSS can be and the purpose of certain faunctions. There are many elements and selectors to learn. This will happen over time and understanding how to style my HTML is the goal. I have a design concept in mind that is almost manifested. This will help my project stand-out. The design purely comes from my desire.
